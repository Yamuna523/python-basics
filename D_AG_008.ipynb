        "Answer: Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).\n",

        "1. Linearity: There must be a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "The data should follow a straight-line trend.\n",

        "2. Independence of Errors: The residuals (errors) must be independent of each other.\n",
        "No correlation should exist between error terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance): The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of X.\n",
        "Points should be evenly spread around the regression line.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors: The residuals should follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "This is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
